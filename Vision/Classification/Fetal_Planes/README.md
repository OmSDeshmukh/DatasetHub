# Dataset: Fetal Planes

Welcome to the **Fetal Planes** dataset folder! This directory contains all the necessary resources to download, prepare, and load the dataset for your machine learning tasks.

---

## Background

The Maternal-fetal ultrasound (US) dataset contains 12400 maternal-fetal anatomical planes, which are divided into six classes: **fetal-abdomen** (711), **fetal-brain** (3092), **fetal-femur** (1626), **fetal-thorax** (1040), **maternal-cervix** (4213) and **others** (1718).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with **Fetal Planes** dataset, follow these steps:


### 1. Requirements

You might need to download some python packages for running the `dataprep.py` and `dataloader.py`. Run the following commands to download required python packages.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio pillow numpy pandas tqdm multiprocess zipfile
```

### 2. Download the Dataset

You can download the dataset from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/3904280)


#### Instructions:
When using the above link, the code for data preparation is present in the `dataprep.py` file itself.

#### Note:
You may need to agree to the dataset's terms of use before downloading the files.


### 3. Prepare the Dataset

Run the file **`dataprep.py`** to prepare the data for use. This script unzips the downloaded file and extracts the contents to the desired directory.

Run the following command to begin preparing the dataset:
```bash
python dataprep.py
```


### 4. Dataloader

Once the dataset is prepared, the dataloader for using the dataset is present in **`dataloader.py`**. This handles loading, transforming, and batching the dataset.

For a sample output of input shapes, run the following
```bash
python dataloader.py
```

You will get a sample image shapes, labels when you run this script.
